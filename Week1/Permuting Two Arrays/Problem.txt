There are two n-element arrays of integers, A and B. Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >= k holds for all i where 0<=i<n.

There will be q queries consisting of A, B, and k. For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

Example
A = [0,1]
B = [0,2]
k = 1

A valid A',B' is A' =[1,0] and B' = [0,2]:1 + 0 >= 1 and 0 + 2 >= 1. Return YES.

Function Description

Complete the twoArrays function in the editor below. It should return a string, either YES or NO.

twoArrays has the following parameter(s):

int k: an integer
int A[n]: an array of integers
int B[n]: an array of integers

Returns
- string: either YES or NO

Input Format

The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries.

The next q sets of 3 lines are as follows:

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the size of both arrays A and B, and the relation variable.
The second line contains n space-separated integers A[i].
The third line contains n space-separated integers B[i].
Constraints
1 <= q <= 10
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= k <= 10^9
0 <= A[i],B[i]<=10^9
