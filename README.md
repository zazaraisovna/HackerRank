# HackerRank
These are puzzles for the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenge, written and solved in the C# (also C++) programming language.

## The Puzzles
I've put each puzzle into its own folder because then I can give each its own README. I'll use this to write a little explanation of how it works, why I did something a certain way, or some other useful notes that may be helpful to people learning.
